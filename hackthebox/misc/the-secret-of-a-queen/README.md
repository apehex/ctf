# The secret of a queen

> **Decrypt the code and find the Queen's secret!**

## Random observations

The image is a ciphertext made of greek symbols:
- all lowercase
- with repetitions
- looks like an equation

The png appears to be valid, without hidden content.

Possibilities:
- symbol mapping
- modifiers / rule based
- a puzzle, rebus
- some mathematical formula?

## Stats

- &infin;: 2
- &epsilon;: 4
- &ne;: 3
- &igma;: 2
- etc...

## Ngrams

... Actually I just followed my first hunch and google "queen cipher":
the queen Mary of Scotland used a specific cipher to plot against the queen
of Britain.

It was the Babington plot, the cipher was actually decrypted and Mary beheaded.

It's a substitution scheme, symbols being either letters or words.

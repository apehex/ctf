# Mission pinpossible

> **Our field agent cannot access the enemy base due to the password-protected
> internal gates, but observed that the password seemed to be partially
> displayed as it was typed into the security keypad. Thanks to an audacious
> mission, we were able to implant an embedded device into the wiring for the
> keypad's monitor, and intercepted some data. Your mission is to recover the
> password from the collected data.**
